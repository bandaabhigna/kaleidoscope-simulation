# zense_project
kaleidoscope simulation
INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO RUN RUN THE CODE:

Firstly install the mathplotlib library in your ubuntu system.
Type this terminal :sudo apt-get build-dep python-matplotlib
Or follow the link https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html

Execute the Programs in Python3.

The Project has two parts: object and image
I have written them in seperate programs.
The program object.py has the code for object
The program image.py has the code for the corresponding image created from object. 
Execute each of them by typing python3 object.py and python3 image.py to see the output.
